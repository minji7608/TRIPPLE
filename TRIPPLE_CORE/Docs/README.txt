INTRODUCTION
------------
TRIPPLE is an interactive audio visualizer built using python language. The purpose of this project is to provide a creative way of visualizing audio data interactively.  

There are two main modes of TRIPPLE: live mode and song mode. 
In live mode, users can visualize audio directly from the microphone. In song mode, the same interface is used, but the music playing in the background triggers the visualizer to animate according to the song playing. Note that in both modes, the analysis and visualization is done live.
